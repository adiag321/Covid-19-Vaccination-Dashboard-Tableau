## Data
The data has been taken from Our World in Data, which maintains, tracks & updates COVID-19 data in its GitHub repository regularly.

This analysis uses data from the files ‘vaccinations.csv’ and ‘locations.csv’. The file ‘vaccinations.csv’ contains country-wise, region-wise & worldwide data relating to Total Vaccinations, Daily Vaccinations, People Vaccinated at least once, People fully Vaccinated, etc. The file ‘locations.csv’ contains country-wise data relating to Vaccination types/brands.

Data right from the beginning of vaccine administration in December 2020 to April 17, 2021, is in the scope of this analysis.

## Planning the Dashboard
A key step for building an effective dashboard is planning. A few important metrics I would like this dashboard to reflect are:

Different Types of Vaccinations are available & mostly used
People Vaccinated, both Once and Fully
Total Vaccinations administered till date
Daily Vaccinations administered
This may require around 4–6 visualizations, using the most appropriate type for each metric.
